#myCalculator

A calculator of my making :)

### Feedback

**Feedback** is much **appreciated** since it was really hard to come up with the
code and maybe there are still some possibilities for a mistake.

### Installation

I used my static-boilerplate repo to make the website.
In case you want to install:

1) `cd /*YOUR DIRECTORY*/`

2) `git clone https://github.com/ivangeorgiew/myCalculator.git`

3) `npm i`

4) `gulp`
